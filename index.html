            <p>For level 0 of over the wire we will just need to login The details are given for us. Login using the following:</p>

            <pre id="codeBlocks">
                <code>
                $ ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 
                </code> 
            </pre>

            <p>What does all the above letter soup mean you wonder? Let's break it down!</p>

            <p>
                First with ssh we tell the computer. "Hey, you have this thing called Secure SHell. I want to use that command."
                <br/><br/>
                Then we say where we want to ssh to. You will see the next part kinda looks like an email? It can be interpreted in the same way. The first part before the @ is the user we want to be. In this case bandit0. After the @ is the domain we want to be at. In this case: bandit.labs.overthewire.org. Neat! <br/><br/>
                Lastly we have this weird -p thing... what's that about? Long story short this specifies the network port you want to connect to. Web servers use ports to keep their services and communicaton streams seperate.
             </p>
            <p>
                If you have never logged in to over the wire you will be promted to accept a Key. Huh? What? Keys? <br/><br/>
                Basically what is happening here is. When you encrypt something you and the person you are talking to need to agree on how things will be enctypted. This key is part of the cipher you will need to encrypt things to securely talk to the server you are connecting to. <br/><br/>
                What does all this "The authenticity of host '[bandit.labs.overthewire.org]:2221 ([176.9.9.172]:2220)' can't be established." Mean? Well in the scary world of the internet we have some authorities that can validate that someone is who they say they are. This is just saying these authorities don't have a record for this key or who it belongs to. Rest assured though. You can accept this key. So just say yes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next we will be prompted for the password to login with. Luckily they give this to you!
            </p>
            <pre id="codeBlocks">
                <code>
                bandit0  
                </code> 
            </pre>
            <p>
                Enter this password and you are now logged in as another user, on another computer, somewhere else completely on the earth. That's insane!
            </p>
            <p>
                The next instructions are also given to you this early in the game. The next password is in a file called readme and we use that password to log into the next level. To read it use the cat command.
            </p>
            <pre id="codeBlocks">
                <code>
                $ cat readme 
                </code> 
            </pre>

            <p>
                The cat command just reads some text and prints it out to the terminal for you to read. I still personally like to imagine that the floating cat head from Alice in wonderland is reading it to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Copy this weird long looking password. Exit your connection session by typing:
            </p>
            <pre id="codeBlocks">
                <code>
                $ exit 
                </code> 
            </pre>
            <p>into your terminal. And you should be back to your home terminal.</p>
            <p>Sweet! We did it. Now we can go on to the next level. Ready?</p>
        </div>

    
        <button class="accordion">Bandit  1</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Now we are at our first challange. here the password is stored in a file called: -</p>
            <p>Cool, we read a file last time... just use cat? Ah... doesn't work.. what gives?</p>
            <p>When cat sees the "-" it does not interpret this as a file name, it interprets it as another way to represent stdin (standard input, basically where your computer receives input from, no need to worry about this to much at the moment).</p>
            <p>Well how do we get around this? We would need to tell cat to interpret this as a file name. To do this we need to use a special character combination in linux:</p>
            <pre id="codeBlocks">
                <code>
                $ ./ 
                </code> 
            </pre>
            <p>Well that looks really weird... what does it do? In linux this is a way to tell a command, or anything almost that "Hey, I want to to look for or do this thing in the directory that we currently are." Directories are the same thing as folders on Windows.</p>

            <p>So to read the password file we would need to:
                <pre id="codeBlocks">
                    <code>
                    $ cat ./- 
                    </code> 
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>Great! That was weird but not too hard. Ready for the next level? Let's go!</p>
        </div>


        <button class="accordion">Bandit  2</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>So our next machine needs us to open a file with spaces in it. Luckily this is super easy. </p>
            <p>What makes opening a file with spaces different is that the terminal does not interpret the space as space character. It thinks you want to open another file. So:</p>
            <pre id="codeBlocks">
                <code>
                $ cat this file
                </code> 
            </pre>
            <p>Would be asking the computer to:
                -cat the file: this<br>
                -cat the file: file<br>
                So the error we will get with this is telling us that the file name we put in to cat does not exist. As all of these treated as seperate file names and are thus not valid names of things that we can cat.
            </p>
            <p>
                How do we get around this? There are two ways we can go about this
            </p>
            <p>Well we need to tell the terminal that the string of text we put in is the exact wording. And just as with english. We use qoutes! So we need:
            </p>
            <pre id="codeBlocks">
                <code>
                $ cat "spaces in this filename"
                </code> 
            </pre>
            <p>
                Basically what this is saying is. Everything in the qoutes is the exact words and formating(spaces included) that I want.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another way we can do this is with back slashes. What these do is they escape the function of the character being fed to the terminal. So by default it would mean "Hey here is a space, so things after this character is considered a new file.". By escaping this meaning we can have the space be what we are use to it being in text files. So it would look like:
            </p>

            <pre id="codeBlocks">
                <code>
                $ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
                </code> 
            </pre>
            <p>
                Woah! That looks kinda funky! Do I need to remember how to format this? Luckily not! Linux has this super cool feature called tab complete.
            </p>
            <p>
                what tab complete does is search for files or folders in the dierectory that you are currently in and try and match the name as best as possible. So try typing:
            </p>
            <pre id="codeBlocks">
                <code>
                $ cat sp
                </code> 
            </pre>
            <p> 
                And now press space. It will complete it all for you! Sweet! 
            </p>
            <p>Submitting the command one of these two ways will get you the next password and we are on our way to level 3!</p>
